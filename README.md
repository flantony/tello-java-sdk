Simple library to control a Ryze Tech Tello EDU drone

Somehow a Ryze Tech Tello EDU was delivered to me due to some black friday madness... 
I wrote some lines of Java code to controll its basic functionallity. It is by no means complete or finished yet, 
but maybe it helps to get started. So feel free to take what you need.
